            <h2>Data Engineering Intern</h2>
            <h4>Summer 2019/Fall 2019</h4>
            <p>At State Farm, my main project was to create an ETL pipelines that pulled data from different platforms,
            such as Hadoop, DB2 and SAS Datasets, into single datasets. This project required me to profile data from
                each source to determine which features were important for my business case. <br><br>
            Technologies that I used were Spark, Scala, Python, Hive, Impala, YARN, and SQL. </p>

            <h2>SpaceTraders Game</h2>
            <h4>Spring 2019</h4>
            <p>SpaceTraders was a group project for a intro to software engineering course. For the project,
            my team and I had to follow certain requirements to create an Android game. I worked partially on the
            backend, helped develop a system to save user data, and developed most of the front end including the media
            and graphics. As extra credit, I chose to create a web implementation of the app using JavaScript and Flask.
            <br><br>Technologies I used for the main project included Java, Android Studio, and Maven. For the extra credit,
            I used Python and JavaScript.</p>

            <h2>Software Development Intern</h2>
            <h4>Summer 2018</h4>
            <p>While working with Speakalytics, I worked on a project that would allow clients to view the data
                Speakalytics kept on their company. The overall goal was to retrieve data from a knowledge graph
                database in Neo4j and display that data in the browser based off certain filters.<br><br>
                Technologies that I used were AngularJS, ExpressJS, Neo4j, HTML, and Python. </p>
